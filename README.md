# xgboostest

xboosttest explores extreme boost test algorithm for time series prediction. This is taken from a blog post by Jason Brownlee on March 19, 2021 in XGBoost [https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-for-time-series-forecasting/](https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-for-time-series-forecasting/) augmented with my own comments.

## What's included

- daily-total-female-births.csv  main.html  main.py
- [`daily-total-female-births.csv`](./daily-total-female-births.csv)
- [`main.py`](./main.py)

## Instructions

1. Install Anaconda [https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html). Probably, `miniconda` will do as well: [https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html) (not tested).
2. Create new virtual environment with conda: `conda create -n py_310 python=3.10`
3. Active the environment: `conda activate py_310`
4. Install python packages; `pip install -r requirements_xgboostest.txt`
